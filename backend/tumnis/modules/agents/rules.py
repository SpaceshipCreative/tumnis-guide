"""agents pure rules: no I/O, `now` passed in (P1-04, FR-5.9, R-22).

- The run vocabulary (R-22): `RunKind` and `RunStatus` hold every value phases 1 to 4 use,
  so later phases change behavior and never the `runs` CHECK constraints.
- Runner presence: a runner heartbeats every `HEARTBEAT_S` seconds; it is offline once
  `MISSED_BEATS` beats are missed (strictly more than 45 s since the last one), and
  `never_seen` until its first register.
- Profile and runner names: `NAME_RE` (also what the runner protocol accepts), so a name
  can never carry a path or a shell trick; a few names are reserved.
- `select_runner`: the runner a daemon-transport profile runs on, when it is online and
  lists the profile in its inventory.
